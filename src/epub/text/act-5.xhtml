									<br/>
									<span>It was myself, my brother and his son,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That brought you home and boldly did outdare</span>

									<span>Nor claim no further than your new-fall’n right,</span>

									<span>What with the injuries of a wanton time,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>To gripe the general sway into your hand;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;</span>

									<span>And being fed by us you used us so</span>

Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die, is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man: but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life indeed. The better part of valour is discretion; in the which better part I have saved my life. ’Zounds, I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I’ll make him sure; yea, and I’ll swear I killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I? Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me. Therefore, sirrah, <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">stabbing him</i> with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Takes up <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Hotspur</b> on his back.</i></td>
