									<br/>
									<span>The hope and expectation of thy time</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is ruin’d, and the soul of every man</span>

									<span>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</span>

									<span>So common-hackney’d in the eyes of men,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</span>
									<br/>

									<span>Had still kept loyal to possession</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And left me in reputeless banishment,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</span>

									<span>That men would tell their children “This is he;”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Others would say “Where, which is Bolingbroke?”</span>

									<span>That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ne’er seen but wonder’d at: and so my state,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And won by rareness such solemnity.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The skipping king, he ambled up and down</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Had his great name profaned with their scorns</span>

									<br/>
									<span>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of every beardless vain comparative,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grew a companion to the common streets,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Enfeoff’d himself to popularity;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That, being daily swallow’d by men’s eyes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They surfeited with honey and began</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</span>
									<br/>
									<span>More than a little is by much too much.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So when he had occasion to be seen,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As, sick and blunted with community,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</span>

									<span>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</span>
